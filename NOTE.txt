The final assigment was the following
"Imagine you're going to start your own logistics company which will deliver Great Stuff to the people of Great Britain. 
Where is the best place to put your delivery hub? Where can you best serve the people of 
Britain from at the minimum cost in terms of distance you need to travel?
You'll need GBplaces.csv. You know how to read CSV data. You need to find out how to calculate 
the Great-Circle distance between two points described by their latitude and longitude - this is called the Haversine formula.
Together with the program hill.cpp that I showed in lectures, and available in the Week 10 course folder, this should provide enough
to complete the assignment.".
Console application 4 and 6 contains my solution to this. 4 is a simple way to do it,
it would only earn the marks that was awarded for a right solution. 6 is a more complicated solution where I used K-nearest mean to
calculate the optimal place for the hub.
